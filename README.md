# Splitora Backend

This Spring Boot project serves as a backend for a clone of Splitora, a popular expense management application. The API provides endpoints for managing users, groups, expenses, and settlements, facilitating seamless expense tracking and splitting among users.

## Features

- **User Management**: Allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles.
- **Group Management**: Enables users to create, join, and manage groups for shared expenses.
- **Expense Tracking**: Facilitates the creation, editing, and deletion of expenses within groups.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building Java-based applications, providing a robust development environment.
- **Spring Security**: Utilized for implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides a convenient way to access relational databases, simplifying database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Chosen as the database management system for storing user data, group information, and expenses.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for secure authentication by generating tokens for authorized users.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satwik-Bhardwaj/Splitora.git
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Install MySQL and create a database named `Splitora`.
   - Update `application.properties` with your MySQL username and password:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Splitora
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=root
     ```

3. **OAuth Configuration**:
   - Obtain credentials from GCP to enable OAuth functionality.
   - Update `application.properties` with the following parameters:
     ```properties
     spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=abc123
     spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=good123
     ```
   - If you do not require OAuth2 functionality, you can remove the related parameters and the corresponding controllers and services.

## Running the Application with Docker & Docker Compose
### 1. **Build and Start the Containers**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- `--build`: Rebuilds the images before starting the containers.

Your Spring Boot application will be accessible at 👉 **http://localhost:8081**

### 2️. **Stop the Containers**
```bash
docker-compose down
```
This will stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose up`.

## Postman Collection
To get started with the API, you can import the Postman collection available on Google Drive:

## Usage

- **Authentication**: Use the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint to obtain a JWT token by providing valid credentials.
- **Endpoints**: Utilize the provided endpoints to perform various operations such as user registration, group creation, expense management, etc.
- **Authorization**: Ensure proper authorization by including the JWT token in the Authorization header for secured endpoints.
